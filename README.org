* cmacrae's config
[[https://builtwithnix.org][https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_With-Nix-5277C3.svg?logo=nixos&labelColor=73C3D5]]

A collection of system configurations, expressed in [[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]].
This repository is based on [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Nix Flakes]], composed elegantly by [[https://github.com/nix-community/flakelight/][flakelight]].

** Conventions
- All non-nix configuration that could be considered inconvenient to maintain as a string lives in =conf.d=
- To keep things tidy, flakelight allows for the use of a directory structure that mimic's a flake's =outputs=. As such, expressions can be found in their dir counterparts under =nix/= (with one exception: =nixosConfigurations= -> =nixos=)
- In keeping with good practices, common "recipies" are presented as modules which are "layered" onto a system's configuration. For example, a laptop configuration may import: =common=, =home=, and =graphical= modules - which are defined under =nix/nixosModules=
- Individual machine configurations are kept as minimal as possible, such that they only include properties pertaining only to that machine
 
** Features
Quite hard to capture all the benefits I feel I've garnered by way of my meticulous obsession with declarative systems, but here are a few key points
- Supports some flake native conventions: additional *checks* (=nix flake check=) with [[https://github.com/astro/deadnix][deadnix]] & [[https://github.com/NerdyPepper/statix][statix]], *formatter* (=nix fmt=) with [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-fmt][nixpkgs-fmt]] (also enforced /in-editor/ via [[https://github.com/nix-community/nixd][nixd]])
- Dead-simple remote deployments with [[https://github.com/pinpox/lollypops][lollypops]], mapped to a flake *app* (=nix run= interface for deployments & local rebuild)
- Secrets management is also handled by [[https://github.com/pinpox/lollypops][lollypops]], backed by [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]], which I secure with a YubiKey (in fact all cryptographic operations, including SSH - which extends to the previously mentioned deployments - and Git signing, all go via PGP, and thus my YubiKey)
- Graphical systems are pure Wayland: minimal session management handled by [[https://sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/greetd/][greetd]]/[[https://github.com/apognu/tuigreet][tuigreet]], colour scheme (configurable on a per-system basis) inherited with [[https://github.com/danth/stylix][stylix]] (further composed & mapped to CSS)
- My other OS, Emacs, wrapped up into a package, nixified via [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][emacs-overlay]]'s =emacsWithPackagesFromUsePackage=, with an =init.el= derivation included in relevant system closures
- Many more fancy things... 💫
  
** Machines
There are several machines defined in =nix/nixos=
 
*** midnight
My daily driver: an M2 MacBook Air (running NixOS, courtesy of the amazing [[https://asahilinux.org/][Asahi Project]] & [[https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon][nixos-apple-silicon]]). A minimal macOS installation remains, but it's pretty much just an Ableton hypervisor
 
*** net1
A Raspberry Pi 5 that acts as a DHCP (Kea), DNS (blocky), and proxy (nginx) server for upstream media services, also a WireGuard gateway to my home network

*** compute1, compute2, compute3
3 Intel NUCs that occupy 1u in my cabinet. Homelab & various media management services
